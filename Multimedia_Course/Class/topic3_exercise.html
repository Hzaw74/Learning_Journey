        <h1>Simple Sponge Cake</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>150g caster sugar</li>
            <li>150g self-raising flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes on Ingredients</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Caster Sugar</dt>
                <dd>Finely granulated white sugar</dd>
            <dt>Self-rasing flour</dt>
                <dd> A pre-mixed combination of flour and leavning agents</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C fan/gas.</li>
                <li>Break the eggs into a large bowl and add the sugar. Using an electric whisk, beat the eggs and sugar together until thick and pale, and when the whisk is lifted, the mixture falls back in thick ribbons. This will take about 5-8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sift the flour into the bowl a little at a time, folding it in gently with a large metal spoon or spatula. Be careful not to knock out the air you've just beaten in.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared cake tin and level the surface with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly pressed in the centre.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
